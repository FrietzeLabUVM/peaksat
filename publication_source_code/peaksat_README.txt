This file shows how we do the quality control, run peaksat analysis, and use H4K5ac as a case study.

3 parts are included in this comprehensive analysis mentioned in the manuscript
	Part 1: Almost all paper figures were generated by peaksat_paper.Rmd with some additions and changes for review included in peaksat_paper.figure3.Rmd and peaksat_paper.CTCF.Rmd. All of the processing intensive step1 subsampling and peak calls was done using the scripts in the "processing_scripts" directory.

	Part 2: peaksat analysis
		--> step 1: Peaksat_estimation_step1.Rmd
		--> step 2: Peaksat_estimation_step2.Rmd

	Part 3: case study on H4K5ac
		--> CSAW analysis: H4K5ac_CSAW_analysis.Rmd
		--> H4K5ac CSAW signal heatmap: H4K5ac_CSAW_plots.Rmd
